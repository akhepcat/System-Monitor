Apologies, but I've migrated the data measurements from the unique
datasources into a converged datasource so that it's easier to switch
between sensors and their available data without changing the upstream
grafana graph definitions.

1) stop all poller systems from pushing sensor data (i.e., comment them out from /etc/default/sysmon )

2) as your 'influxdb' user,  open 'influxdb'  and run the following commands,
   assuming you're using the same database name as I am:

	use sysmon
	SELECT * INTO environmental from bmp180 GROUP BY host
	SELECT * INTO environmental from scd4x GROUP BY host
	DROP MEASUREMENT bmp180
	DROP MEASUREMENT scd4x

3) start all poller systems' sensor modules

4) make one last change to your grafana graph configs
5) there is no number 5
6) never worry about changing between sensor types, or adding new sensors, because they'll
   all use the same measurement table.
