Help, I started polling a host before changing the poller name, how do i get rid of the old data?

$ sudo influx
> use sysmon
> show series where host='poller'
key
---
cpu,host=poller
disk_usage,drive=sda2,host=poller,mount=/boot
disk_xfer_rate,drive=sda2,host=poller,mount=/boot
load,host=poller
net_xfer_rate,host=poller,interface=ens192

> drop series from cpu where host='poller';
> drop series from disk_usage where host='poller';
> drop series from disk_xfer_rate where host='poller';
> drop series from net_xfer_rate where host='poller';

> show series where host='poller';
> 
> exit
